    ## Input Graph File Format
    __Line 1__: 3 space separated integers N, T, M, representing the number of vertices, terminal vertices, and edges respectively.
    __Line 2__: T space separated integers representing the rank of the terminal vertices, in the range 0..N-1
    __Lines 3..E+2__: Each line contains 2 space separated integers u, v in 0..N-1, representing an edge (undirected or directed, depending on context) between vertices u and v.
